# SingleCellPlots
Easy code to plot gene expression by cell type in publicly available datasets using Seurat

Melanoma and HNSCC datasets processed per https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11738-0

Healthy PBMC data available from 10X Genomics; cell types annotated per Seurat tutorial

I simplified just a bit from the excellent work by the paper authors and Seurat developers

Rds files of pre-processed Seurat ojects: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G2IlpMo6AWVmG3rpeWPs5i0Bg9UFlkMO?usp=sharing

[Code here](scplots.R) shows how to take the pre-processed Seurat objects and plot your gene of interest by cell type

Minimal R skills needed
